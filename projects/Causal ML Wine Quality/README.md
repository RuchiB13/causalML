## Introduction

Wine's physical properties create its taste, meaning if the physical process can be modeled, one can understand why certain wines are more highly rated than others. In the Wine Terroir section, we explore how the growing condition impacts the physical conditions and overall rating of the wine. Because the chemical interactions in grape growing and winemaking are understood, we can create a causal model of the process to find the reason for certain ratings. In the other wine analysis, we look more closely at the chemistry of wine, which is again possible because we use a dag informed by chemical properties.
